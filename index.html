                       <h3>Computer Science Engineering</h3>
                    Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at some universities
                     that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science, providing
                     knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design.Computer Science
                     Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis
                     of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.

                     Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and
                     linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering
                     departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.
                     Careers 
                     • Software Developers : Software developers are professionals who are concerned with facets of
                     the software development process which involves activities such as design and coding, computer
                     programming, project management, etc.  
                     • Hardware Engineers : These professionals do research, design, develop, test, and oversee the
                     installation of computer hardware which inter alia includes computer chips, circuit boards, systems,
                     modems, keyboards, and printers.
                     • System Designer : Professionals involved in system designing, Logical & Physical Designing wherein 
                     logical designing can be enumerated as the structure & characteristics such as output, input, files,
                     database & procedures, etc.
                      <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
                       It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. Electrical engineers
                       work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators.
                       Early experiments with electricity included primitive batteries and static charges. However, the actual design
                       construction and manufacturing of useful devices and systems began with the implementation of Michael Faraday's 
                       Law of Induction, which essentially states that the voltage in a circuit is proportional to the rate of change
                       in the magnetic field through the circuit. This law applies to the basic principles of the electric generator,
                       the electric motor and the transformer. The advent of the modern age is marked by the introduction of electricity 
                       to homes, businesses and industry, all of which were made possible by electrical engineers. 
                      <h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
                       The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics,
                       thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles,
                       mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product
                       lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling
                       systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of 
                       engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.Mechanical engineering emerged as a field
                       during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several
                       thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical
                       engineering science
